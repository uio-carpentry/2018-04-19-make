  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->
<p>
  <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a>'s mission
  is to help scientists and engineers get more research done in less
  time and with less pain by teaching them basic lab skills for
  scientific computing.  
  
  <p align="center">
  <em>
    For more information on what we teach and why,
    please see our paper
    "<a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745">Best Practices for Scientific Computing</a>".
  </em>
</p>

This one-day 
  <a href="http://www.uio.no/english/for-employees/support/research/research-data/training/carpentry/">Carpentry@UiO</a> 
  hands-on workshop will cover 
  the Software Carpentry lesson on automating tasks on the Unix shell using <strong>Make</strong>.
Make is a tool which can run commands to read files, process these files in some way, 
and write out the processed files. For example, in software development, 
Make is used to compile source code into executable programs or libraries. 
But, Make can also be used to:

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>run analysis scripts on raw data files to get data files that summarize the raw data;</li>
<li>run visualization scripts on data files to produce plots; and to</li>
<li>parse and combine text files and plots to create papers.</li>
</ul>

Make is called a build tool - it builds data files, plots, papers, programs or libraries. 
It can also update existing files if desired. Make tracks the dependencies 
between the files it creates and the files used to create these. 
If one of the original files (e.g. a data file) is changed, 
then Make knows to recreate, or update, 
the files that depend upon this file (e.g. a plot).

</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span6">
    <h4>Editor</h4>
    <p>
      Make sure you install, or have available, a text editor that
      you are comfortable with using.
      When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text
      editor that is optimized for writing code, with features
      like automatic color-coding of key words.
    </p>
    <h4>The Bash Shell</h4>
    <p>
      Bash is a commonly-used shell. Using a shell gives you
      more power to do more tasks more quickly with your
      computer.
    </p>
    <h4>Git</h4>
    <p>
      Git is a state-of-the-art version control system. It
      lets you track who made changes to what when and has
      options for easily updating a shared or public version of
      your code on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="span6">
    <h4>Python</h4>
    <p>
      Python is becoming very popular in scientific computing,
      and it's a great language for teaching general programming concepts due to its easy-to-read syntax.
      We teach with Python version 2.7,
      since it is still the most widely used.
      Installing all the scientific packages for Python individually can be a bit difficult,
      so we recommend an all-in-one installer.
    </p>
    <h4>Make</h4>
    <p>
      Originally invented to manage compilation of programs written in
      languages like C, Make can be used to automatically update any set
      of files that depend on another set of files. This makes it a good
      solution for many data analysis and data management
      problems. While there are many build tools now in existence
      (e.g. ANT and CMake) they share the same fundamental concepts as
      Make. 
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<h3>Windows</h3>

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span6">
    <h4>Editor</h4>
    <p>
      <code>nano</code> is the editor installed by the Software Carpentry Installer,
      it is a basic editor integrated into the lesson material.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> is a
      popular free code editor for Windows.
      Be aware that you must add its installation directory to your system path
      in order to launch it from the command line
      (or have other tools like Git launch it for you).
      Please ask your instructor to help you do this.
    </p>
    <h4>Git Bash</h4>
    <p>
      Install Git for Windows by download and running
      <a href="http://msysgit.github.io/">the installer</a>.
      This will provide you with both Git and Bash in the Git Bash program.
    </p>
    <h4>Software Carpentry Installer</h4>
    <p>This installer requires an active internet connection</p>
    <p>After installing Python and Git Bash:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Download the <a href="http://files.software-carpentry.org/SWCarpentryInstaller.exe">installer</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the file opens directly in the browser select <strong>File&rarr;Save Page As</strong>
        to download it to your computer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Double click on the file to run it.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="span6">
    <h4>Python</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Download and install  <a href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/">Anaconda</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use all of the defaults for installation
        <em>except</em>
        make sure to check <strong>Make Anaconda the default Python</strong>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Make</h4>
    <p>
    NOTE: The Software Carpentry Windows installer installs Make.
    When using the installer, start at the 'To test:' part below.
    <p>
    Once you have installed Git Bash you can install Make by:
    <ul>
    <li>
    Download <code>make.exe</code> from <a
href="https://github.com/msysgit/msysgit/blob/master/bin/make.exe?raw=true">here</a>
    </li>
    <li>
    Place it in the <code>bin</code> directory where you installed Git
    Bash e.g. <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\bin</code>.
    </li>
    <li> 
    To test: open a Git Bash window, type <code>make</code>, and press
    Enter.
    </li>
    <li> 
    You should see the following message
    <pre>make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found. Stop.</pre>
    This means that Make was successfully installed.
    Otherwise, you'll see this error message:
    <pre>bash: make: command not found</pre>
    </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<h3>Mac OS X</h3>

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span6">
    <h4>Editor</h4>
    <p>
      We recommend
      <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">Text Wrangler</a> or
      <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>.
      In a pinch, you can use <code>nano</code>,
      which should be pre-installed.
    </p>
    <h4>Bash</h4>
    <p>
      The default shell in all versions of Mac OS X is bash,
      so no need to install anything.  You access bash from
      the Terminal (found
      in <code>/Applications/Utilities</code>).  You may want
      to keep Terminal in your dock for this workshop.
    </p>
    <h4>Git</h4>
    <p>
      Install Git for Mac by downloading and running
      <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">the installer</a>.  For older
      versions of OS X (10.5-10.7) use the most recent available
      installer <a href="https://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/downloads/list">available
      here</a>. Use the Leopard installer for 10.5 and the Snow Leopard
      installer for 10.6-10.7.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="span6">
    <h4>Python</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Download and install <a href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/">Anaconda</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use all of the defaults for installation
        <em>except</em>
        make sure to check <strong>Make Anaconda the default Python</strong>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Make</h4>
    <p>
    For OS X, version 10.9 (Mavericks) or above, download the Command Line
    Tools by doing:    
    </p>
    <pre>xcode-select  --install</pre>
    <p>
    For more information, see the <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/">OSX Daily blog</a>.
    </p>
    If you have an older OS X version and you do not already have 
    access to <code>make</code> from within
    your shell, you will need to install XCode (which is free, but
    over a gigabyte to download). 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Go to the Apple app store</li>
      <li>Search for XCode</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Free</strong></li>
      <li>Click <strong>Install App</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Once XCode has installed:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Click <strong>Applications</strong></li>
      <li>Click <strong>XCode</strong></li>
      <li>Select <strong>XCode&rarr;Preferences...</strong></li>
      <li>Click <strong>Downloads</strong></li>
      <li>Select <strong>Command Line Tools</strong></li>
      <li>Click <strong>Install</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    You will now be able to run <code>make</code> within your shell.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<h3>Linux</h3>

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span6">
    <h4>Editor</h4>
    <p>
      <a href="http://kate-editor.org/">Kate</a> is one option for Linux users.
      In a pinch, you can use <code>nano</code>,
      which should be pre-installed.
    </p>
    <h4>Bash</h4>
    <p>
      The default shell is usually <code>bash</code>,
      but if your machine is set up differently
      you can run it by opening a terminal and typing <code>bash</code>.
      There is no need to install anything.
    </p>
    <h4>Git</h4>
    <p>
      If Git is not already available on your machine you can try
      to install it via your distro's package manager
      (e.g. <code>apt-get</code> or <code>yum</code>).
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="span6">
    <h4>Python</h4>
    <p>
      We recommend the all-in-one scientific Python installer
      <a href="http://continuum.io/downloads.html">Anaconda</a>.
      (Installation requires using the shell and if you aren't
      comfortable doing the installation yourself just
      download the installer and we'll help you at the workshop.)
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Download the installer that matches your operating
        system and save it in your home folder.
      </li>
      <li>
        Open a terminal window.
      </li>
      <li>
        Type <pre>bash Anaconda-</pre> and then press
        tab. The name of the file you just downloaded should
        appear.
      </li>
      <li>
        Press enter. You will follow the text-only
        prompts. When there is a colon at the bottom of the
        screen press the down arrow to move down through the
        text. Type <code>yes</code> and press enter to approve
        the license. Press enter to approve the default
        location for the files. Type <code>yes</code> and
        press enter to prepend Anaconda to
        your <code>PATH</code> (this makes the Anaconda
        distribution the default Python).
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Make</h4>
    <p>
    Make is a standard tool on Linux systems and should already be
    available.
    </p>
